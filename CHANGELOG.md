## [16.4.0] - 2024-07-03

 - A new sample, `Text Chat Sample`, to the package: This text-focused sample showcases a robust chat experience that demonstrates sending, editing, and deleting DM or channel messages along with retrieving past conversations and their message history.

### Added
 - Added a number of generated APIs back to the SDK which were previously being omitted.

### Fixed
 - Fixed an issue with Build Configuration values being stored as nulls instead of empty strings which caused an exception in the editor if a project was not linked in the Project Settings.

## [15.1.180001-pre.4] - 2022-08-08
### Changed
 - Adjusted the Windows and Mac VivoxNative library .meta files to enable `Load on Startup` so they get loaded in regardless of the build target of the editor. Notably, this caused compiler errors when entering Play Mode if the editor build target was iOS since our Mac library, which gets used for the editor alongside the Windows library, wasn't loaded yet.

### Fixed
 - Fixed an issue with various plugin `.meta` files not targeting their specific platform resulting in editor crashes when entering Play Mode if additional Vivox platform packages got installed.
 - Fixed an issue that would cause a compiler error if the Authentication package wasn't available to the ChatChannelSample. The Authentication package should get automatically pulled in when the ChatChannelSample is installed, but if it hadn't been, a compiler error would appear.

## [15.1.180001-pre.3] - 2022-07-13
